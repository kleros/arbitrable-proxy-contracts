/**
 *  @title RealitioArbitratorProxyWithAppeals
 *  @dev A proxy contract for Realitio with extra logic to form an adapter between Kleros and Realitio. It notifies Realitio contract for arbitration requests and creates corresponding dispute on Kleros. Transmits Kleros ruling to Realitio contract. Maintains crowdfunded appeals and notifies Kleros contract. Provides a function to submit evidence for Kleros dispute.
 *  Disputes happen between the last answer and the challengers answer. But Kleros can rule for any valid answer as a response.
 *  There is a conversion between Kleros ruling and Realitio answer and there is a need for shifting by 1. For reviewers this should be a focus as it's quite easy to get confused. Any mistakes on this conversion will render this contract useless.
 *  NOTE: This contract trusts to the Kleros arbitrator and Realitio.
